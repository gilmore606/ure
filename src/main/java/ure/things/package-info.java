/**
 * Thing represents a movable physical entity in the world.  It can contain other Things inside it.  The
 * various ThingI subclasses implement various common types of entities.
 *
 * The base ThingI should not be subclassed to a new base class if you want to use the supplied Thing
 * subtypes.  To modify behavior of a URE base class, see the documentation on Decorators.
